  <p>Because the last three movies of this six-movie saga were released first, it sparked additional interest for what the first three movies in the series would have in store. Sixteen years after the original trilogy ended, the first movie in this trilogy was released.</p>

    <h2>The prequel trilogy</h2>
    <li>Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace</li>
